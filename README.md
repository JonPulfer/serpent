Serpent encryption cipher

Overview
--------

This is a Go implementation of the Serpent encryption cipher designed by
Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, Lars Knudsen and based on the python version
written by Frank Stajano, Cambridge University Computer Laboratory 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/

Currently I am writing this as a stand alone package but I plan to convert
it to be part of the crypto package.
